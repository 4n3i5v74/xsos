- - -

**2013/01/16 rsar v0.1.0rc1: made -n opt compatible with sar -n**

* Closed [issue 46 - rsar RFE / BUG: -n opt only shows dev; what about sock, nfs, nfsd, etc?](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/46).

**2013/01/15 rsar v0.0.7: added -I (intr)**

* Closed [issue 44 - rsar RFE: add -I option (for interrupts)](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/44).


**2013/01/14 rsar v0.0.6: big file-handling improvements; see changelog**

* Closed [issue 41 - rsar File-handling is crappy (slow, can't always open compressed files, errors out if any 1 of multiple files are bad or missing)](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/41). See that for full details of what was changed.


**2013/01/13 xsos v0.1.4: re-wrote grub-detection code; grub2 works now**

* Closed [issue 30 - RFE: Have OS detect stuff on grub2 systems](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/30). See that for the full details of how grub-detection changed.

  
**2013/01/13 xsos v0.1.3: massive rewrite (& improvement) of selinux detection code**

* Closed [issue 31 RFE: Improve SELinux detection in sosreports by looking at dmesg](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/31#issuecomment-12200458). See that for full details.


**2013/01/13 rsar v0.0.5: added -S & -H; added bash autocompletion file**

* Closed [issue 45 - rsar RFE: add -S and -H for swap and hugepages](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/45). 
* Also added an `rsar` bash autocompletion file like with xsos below.


**2013/01/13 xsos added bash-completion file yaaaaay**

* Updated xsos readme. Finally added a couple screenshots. Cleaned up a couple things.
* Closed [issue 36 RFE: Add bash completion file for xsos](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/36). Added [xsos-bash-completion.bash](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/blob/master/xsos-bash-completion.bash) file. Simply save the file to: `/etc/bash_completion.d/` ... If running xsos from RHEL6, you probably need to install the bash-completion package from EPEL. :)


**2013/01/10 xsos v0.1.2: meminfo asciiart graphing; random addtl tweaks + a few more commits, up to v0.1.2b**

* Closed [issue 39 - RFE: Add asci-art/graph for meminfo-display](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/issues/39), adding asci-art graphing to meminfo, along with some pretty colors.
* Re-factored meminfo code quite a bit and cleaned up output display. See above closed issue for new look.
* Changed the default color of the `XSOS_COLOR_IMPORTANT` variable to simple *bold* (from cyan).
* Made pscheck display total number of processes
* Made pscheck honor the global indentation variables (still not used everywhere else, e.g. not in meminfo)
* Did some code refactoring to netdev parsing
* Tweaked osinfo wording for /proc/stat
* More changes to sysctl -- added a few *fs* & **kernel* sysctls
* Hard-coded the `pzero` variable to "xsos". People here at Red Hat were redistributing the script with the file being named custom names (e.g. "x") and didn't know what xsos was really called.


**2013/01/06 xsos v0.1.1beta: rewrote sysctl-parsing function for ease of mgmt**

* Function-ified everything in the sysctl function to make everything easier (i.e., reading the code, adding things, and tweaking formatting).
  * Also, I'd like to add the ability to read in files created by `sysctl -a` and this work laid the foundation for that.
* Added multiple new sysctls.
* Added or improved descriptions for multiple existing sysclts.
* Improved color-formatting of sysctls.


**2013/01/04 xsos v0.1.0: massive overhaul of --sysctl**

* In retrospect, this isn't very massive, compared to v0.1.1beta.


**2013/01/01 rsar v0.0.3: works with symlinked sar files; improved speed**

* Just like it says -- rewrote some code to make reading symlinked files possible.
  * As a side effect, the new code is faster. yay.
  
  
**2012/12/29 rsar v0.0.2: a few tweaks**

* Improved a couple little things


**2012/12/28 added rsar -- a sar-data parser + v0.0.1: rsar initial version)**

* Initial commits for `rsar`.


**For changelogs farther back than this, you'll need to inspect [individual commits](https://github.com/ryran/xsos/commits/master). Virtually every one came with a changelog.**
